We notice that e = 32 = 2**5

Finding the original plaintext is trivial in this case.

my caveman solution was to use Alperton Quadratic modular equation solver
https://www.alpertron.com.ar/QUADMOD.HTM

a = 1, b = 0, c = -(cipher), n = MODULUS

It gives you 2 solutions, which one is correct? to the eqaution of : c4^2 = c5 [N]
The one that has another modular square root (a qudratic residue)

Basically keep doing this untill you reach c0^2 = c1 [N]

c0 being your plaintext.
