
fn = lambda x: (x.T * A * x + B.T * x + C)[0][0]

we need the C matrix partx herem therefore the random elements of B and A must be discarded, (x.T * A * x + B.T * x)

attempting to visualize the matrices shows vulnerabilities.

we can get rid of these random instances of B and A using the following:
In the output there is a list with 7 elements, let us call them n1, n2, ..., n7

and we have the modulus P

to get the flag, do: 
long_to_bytes((n7 - n6 + n2 - n3 + n1 + n4 - n5) % p)

(n7 - n6 + n2 - n3 + n1 + n4 - n5) was found by trying combination that got rid of random elements and removing any new ones introduced again.
