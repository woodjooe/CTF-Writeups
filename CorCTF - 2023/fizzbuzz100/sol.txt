for this you must factor the ciphertext given as part of the ouput:

for example: ct is factored into 8 prime numbers pN : p1, p2,...,p8
either sign every single pN and multiply their results for the Plaintext but you run into the problem of one of their results being divisible by 3 or 5.

``` python
    if pt % 3 == 0:
        out += "Fizz"
    if pt % 5 == 0:
        out += "Buzz"
    if not out:
        out = pt
    print(out)
```

or choose combinations of those factors for example, 
p1*p2*p3*p4 and p5*p6*p7*p8
or p1*p2 and p3*p4*p5*p6*p7*p8
etc...
one of these combination will surely get you the flag
